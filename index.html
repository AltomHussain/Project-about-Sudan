                main sources of livelihood in Sudan for about 61 percent of the

                The Autumn

                We rejoiced and had high hopes for the revolutionary movement in
                Sudan, which overthrew the head of the tyrannical authority,
                Omar Hassan al-Bashir. It is a great achievement for the
                Sudanese rebels who refused to leave the streets until their
                demands have been met. They learned the lesson from the Egyptian
                revolution and fully grasped it, chanting the slogan, “Either
                victory or Egypt”We have become an example for people to learn
                from, and this is not bad or harmful, but rather beneficial to
                others. Apart from the national strife, ethnic conflicts, and
                the chauvinistic positions taken by some of the Sudanese people
                who have disowned the first failed Arab Spring revolutions and
                tried to remove their revolution from its Arab surroundings.

                The Climate Change
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                Sudan's inherent vulnerability to climate change is captured by
                the fact that food security is mainly determined by rainfall,
                particularly in rural areas where more than 65% of the
                population lives. In the Kordofan Region, models predict that
                millet production will decline between 15% and 62%, and sorghum
                yield between 29% and 71% in the period 2030-2060. Mainstreaming
                of climate adaptation efforts in the face of such risks will
                require: a national land use plan and reform of land tenure;
                policies and strategies that guarantee food security and the
                provision of safe, potable water; strategies th enhance
                agricultural productivity; and a national early warning system,
                among others..

        <p>
          Sudan, officially the Republic of the Sudan, is a country in eastern
          Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, Libya to the northwest,
          Chad to the west, the Central African Republic to the southwest, South
          Sudan to the south, Ethiopia to the southeast, Eritrea to the east,
          and the Red Sea to the northeast. The history of Sudan includes that
          of both the territory that composes Republic of the Sudan, South Sudan
          as well as that of a larger region known by the term "Sudan". The term
          is derived from Arabic: بلاد السودان‎ bilād as-sūdān, or "land of the
          black people",[1][2] and can be used more loosely of West and Central
          Africa in general, especially the Sahel. The modern Republic of Sudan
          was formed in 1956 and inherited its boundaries from Anglo-Egyptian
          Sudan, established in 1899. For times predating 1899, usage of the
          term "Sudan" for the territory of the Republic of Sudan was somewhat
          anachronistic, and may have referred to the more diffuse concept of
          the Sudan. The early history of the Kingdom of Kush, located along the
          Nile region in what is now northern Sudan, is intertwined with the
          history of ancient Egypt, with which it was politically allied over
          several ruling periods. By virtue of its proximity to Egypt, the Sudan
          participated in the wider history of the Near East, with the most
          popular episodes being the 25th dynasty and the Christianization of
          the three Nubian kingdoms Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia in the sixth
          century. As a result of Christianization
